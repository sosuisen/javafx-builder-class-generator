# JavaFX Builder Class Generator

This VSCode extension provides a builder class generator for JavaFX projects.

You can generate builder classes for various classes included in the `javafx.scene.*` packages, such as `Button` and `VBox` ,
allowing you to create complex instances more compactly.

# How to Use

## 1. üèÉ‚Äç‚û°Ô∏è Move the cursor over a "new ClassName()" expression.
- The class must be from the `javafx.scene.*` packages.
- The class name must be a canonical name or resolved through an import.
- A builder class cannot be generated if the class has no "set-" methods.

## 2. üîß Press "Generate Builder Class" Code Lens.

- A builder class is generated and replaces the original class at the cursor position.

## 3. üéÅ A builder class is created under the jfxbuilder directory.

- The builder class is named by appending the postfix "-Builder" to the original class name.

## 4. ‚öôÔ∏è The builder class includes the same setter methods as the original class, but the "set-" prefix is omitted.

- In the example below, the builder class for the `Button` class is `ButtonBuilder`, which includes a `maxSize` method instead of the `setMaxSize` method.

- The return type of the `maxSize` method is `ButtonBuilder`.

- To create an instance of the original class, call `build()` at the end of the method chain.
